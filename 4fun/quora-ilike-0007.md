## 最好的复仇

From:&nbsp; [What was the best revenge you've ever gotten?](http://qr.ae/TUGGcK)

Date: September 26 2018

It wasn’t me, but a college buddy. But it was so sweet, I have to share.

> 不是我,是我大学里面的一个老铁.但这复仇太甜了(怀疑是狗粮,认真脸),我必须要分享出来.

There was a really beautiful, popular girl my friend, call him Mike, had a serious crush on. He asked her out several times but she was always “busy”. She never really discouraged him though, I think she liked the attention.

> 有一个很漂亮且很受人待见的女孩子,我的老铁,就叫他 Mike 吧,超级喜欢她的.他想约她出去很多次了,但那个女孩子的回复一直是"忙,不约,不约".
> 她从来没有明确的拒绝他,我想她是喜欢获取他的注意吧(备胎 Queue).

One day Mike got ahold of two tickets to a sold out U2 concert. He bought them from a friend who had to go out of town for an emergency.

> 有一天,Mike 拿着两张 U2 的演唱会门票.他从一个临时有急事出外的朋友那里买的.

Mike immediately called the girl of his dreams and of course she accepted. He was thrilled and everything seemed fine.

> Mike 立即打电话给那个他梦里的女孩子,当然那个女孩子接受了.他当然很激动啦,而且所有的事情看起来都往好的方面发展了.(莱纳德的孩子).

The night of the concert they’re at the arena waiting for the show to begin and she suddenly says, “Oh, I see my friend, I’ll be right back!”

> 在演唱会的那晚,他们在舞台前等待着演唱会开始,然后那个女孩子说,"窝草,我看到我的朋友了,我一会再回来!"

You guessed it, she never returned. Mike stayed at the seats since that’s the only place she would logically look for him. When the show ended, Mike ever the gentleman, waited for a long time so he could drive her home. But saw no sign of her. She didn’t answer her phone or texts. So he left feeling so hurt.

> 你猜发生了什么,她根本没再回来.Mike 坐在那里

By the next morning he was rightfully pissed! She called him around noon apologizing and saying she ran into her ex they had a long talk and worked out a lot of stuff and lost track of time. She had actually missed the concert and blah, blah, blah.

> 第二天早上,他正在恼怒的时候.那个女孩子打电话来了,没有一句道歉,然后告诉他,她看见了她的前男友,然后双方展开了一次深刻的对话,解决了很多历史遗留问题以及在人海中重逢.她真的很想念这场音乐会,bla,bla,bla...

He accepted her apology and asked if they could try again. She accepted and told him how very nice and forgiving he was. She had underestimated him!

> 他接受了她的道歉,然后邀请她在出去一次.她接受了,然后给他发好人卡和告诉他是个绝世好男人.但她低估他了.

So the next Saturday evening he took her to a very expensive seafood restaurant about an hour up the coast. He was polite and chatty the whole way up there. He made the reservation in her name.

> 所以第二个星期六晚上,他带她去一个离海边不远的很贵的海鲜餐厅.他很礼貌而且说了很多话,在一路上.他用了她的名字来订餐.

They were seated, ordered a nice bottle of wine, some expensive appetizers and entrees, then Mike excused himself to go to the men’s room. He very deliberately said, “I’ll be right back.”

> 他们入座,点了上好的红酒啦,一些很贵的小菜和主餐,然后 Mike 说他要去厕所啦,他甚至故意的说,"我一会回来."

He walked out to the parking lot and drove away. And became the hero of every good guy who’s been treated like crap by a girl because she just didn’t give a damn about his feelings.

> 他走到停车场,然后回去了.然后成为每一个曾经被那些女孩子当做垃圾对待的备胎的榜样,因为她根本没在乎他的感觉.

I still love that story!!

> 我超喜欢这个故事的.

## 生涯最尬时刻

From:&nbsp; [What is your most embarrassing moment at school?](http://qr.ae/TUGt9E)

Date: September 27 2018

Not mine, but a girl that went to my school.

> 不是我,是一个转来我们学校的女孩子.

One day, out of the blue, this one girl started getting a bigger and bigger stomach. The students noticed pretty quickly, and so did the teachers.

> 那一天,在外边,那个女孩子开始了一阵又一阵的胃痛.那些同学和老师很快意识到她不舒服.

This girl wasn’t exactly a model student. She was pretty well known for partying and drinking and messing around with a lot of different guys.

> 那个女孩子不是颜值逆天的那种学生.众所周知,她喜欢聚会啦,喝酒啦,然后和一堆男的混在一起.

So everyone, including the teachers, realized that she was pregnant.

> 所以每一个人,包括老师,都知道她怀孕了.

She didn’t do a very good job hiding it, and pretty much everyone in the school knew about it. Whenever she walked into the room, there were a lot of whispers among the students. Even the teachers gossiped about her.

> 她没能太好的隐藏这个迹象,所以每一个在学校里面的人都知道了这个消息.不论何时她走进教室里面,学生都在那里议论纷纷.甚至那些老师都有点八卦了.

Eventually, the counselors caught wind of it. They brought in a teenage pregnancy specialist and called the girl in to talk.

> 最后,辅导主任闻到了风.他们带来了早孕的专家然后叫那个女孩子来询问情况.

Imagine their surprise, when they asked the girl what she was planning to do with the baby, and she responded “What baby?”

> 想象一下他们吃惊的表情,当他们问到那个女孩子有什么关于小屁孩的计划的时候,然后那个女孩子说"什么孩子?" 我没有,不知道,别瞎说.jpg

It turns out the girl wasn’t pregnant, she was just really fat.

> 发现那个女孩子并没有怀孕,而仅仅是因为她比较胖而已.

She recently had a messy breakup with her boyfriend and had stopped caring about her health. She used food to deal with her emotions.

> 她最近和她男朋友闹分手,然后对自己的健康一点也不注意.她把悲愤化作力量消灭食物.

Long story short, her stomach was filled with Doritos, not a baby.

> 长话短说,她的胃全是薯片,而不是小屁孩.

The school was extremely embarrassed and tried to cover it up, but completely failed. The entire student body found out.

> 学校觉得很丢脸了,然后尝试去掩盖这件事,但绝壁失败了.整个学校都知道了整件事.

The next year, she transferred schools.

> 第二年,她转校了.

I can’t really blame her.

> 我不能怪她,哈,哈,哈.

## 人生最难放弃的是什么?

From:&nbsp; [What's the hardest thing to give up in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGvU1)

Date: September 28 2018

I have a friend who says her boyfriend has stopped loving her. She tells me every boyfriend she has ever had has stopped loving her. She assures me there is something wrong with her.

> 我有一个朋友说她的男朋友不在喜欢她了.她告诉我她之前的每一个男朋友到最后都不喜欢她了.她像我确认是不是她做错了什么.

Her boyfriend is a friend of mine. His mom died a few months ago and he is mourning.

> 她的男朋友也是我的一个朋友.他的老妈在几个月前去世了,而他现在都还没走出悲伤中去.

What he tells me is that he loves this woman, but that the grief he is managing is too big and is crowding out everything else.

> 他告诉我他还喜欢那个那孩子,但是他要办一个葬礼的太重要,以至于掩盖了生活中的其他事物.

Her insecurity and her insistence that he does not love her is proving too much for him to handle.

> 她的不安和强调他不再喜欢她了,正好说好他现在手上的事情太多了.

I really want to mind my own business but I do try to tell my friend that what her boyfriend is going through has nothing to do with her or his love for her.

> 我很想只管我自己的屁事,但我想去告诉我的朋友,她男朋友现在需要经历的东西和她一点关系也没有,或者告诉她,他还喜欢她.

She shakes her head. She does not want to hear me.

> 她摇了摇头.然后不再想听我说了.

The hardest thing to give up is the thing we have decided to believe.

> 生命里,最难放弃的应该我们曾坚信的东西吧.

## 来呀,相互变好呀.

From:&nbsp; [How can we make the world a better place?](http://qr.ae/TUGyrh)

Date: September 29 2018

Last month, right after we graduated from Yale, my boyfriend and I spent two weeks working on a small organic farm in France.

> 上个月,在我们刚才耶鲁毕业不久,我男票和我花了两周时间在法国弄了一个很小的有机农场.

The owner of our farm turned out to be a tall, wiry man named Emmanuel, with a gruff smile and an easy laugh. He spoke French with his wife and kids, but he’d explain our work to us in English, occasionally pausing in the middle of a word to remember the proper pronunciation.

> 发现那个农场的主人是一个很高大的,嗓音很小的叫 Emmanuel 的男人,带着笑得花枝乱颤,而且还很喜欢笑.他和他的妻儿说法语,但他向我们介绍我们的工作的时候是用英语的.在偶尔,断断续续的说一句话,因为要找到合适的英语单词.

One time, he took us to the greenhouse and showed us spots of brown mold that had begun creeping over the leaves on the tomato plants. “Ze tomatoes get sick sometimes,” he said. “It’s a big…how do you say…a big pr…”

> 有一次,他带我们去温室,然后给我们看了一小块地方,那里都有霉菌在土豆的叶子上繁殖了."这些土豆有时候会生病,"他说."这是一个大的...你们怎么说的,一个很大的..."

A problem? I suggested in my mind, assuming that was the word he was looking for.

> 一个问题?我内心 os 如是,假设这个词是他想说的.

But then Emmanuel smiled and said, “Ah, project. It’s a big project.”

> 但是 Emmanuel 笑着说,"嗯,project,一个很大的项目."

With that, he gave us clippers and buckets, and showed us how to clip off certain leaves from infected tomato plants to prevent the mold from spreading.

> 在那,他把钳子和篮子给我们了,然后教我们怎么从土豆上把感染的枝叶剪下来,防止那些霉菌扩散.

Where I saw a problem, Emmanuel saw a project. This attitude was one he carried with him everywhere, no matter how big the problem or how difficult the solution. He worked from dawn to dusk - often heavy, backbreaking work - fixing the things that other people saw as problems.

> 当我想说是一个问题的时候,Emmanuel 却看见了一个工程.这就是他一直以来的态度了,不论多大的问题和多难的境地.他从早到晚,经常锄禾日当午,修复别人眼里面视为问题的东西.

On my last day working for him, I asked Emmanuel why he decided to become a farmer, and he just shook his head and said, “Ah, zere are lots of people in the world these days, and zat makes a lot of hunger. It’s a big project.”

> 在我最后一天在那工作的时候,我问 Emmanuel 为什么他决定成为一个农夫的,然后他摇了摇头说,"嗯,这世界很多的人在外边,他们制造了饥饿.这是一个很大的工程."

It’s a simple thing, just a casual switch of words - but at the same time, it’s kind of profound.

> 这是一件很简单的事,仅仅是转换一个概念,但是同时意义深远.

Want to make the world a better place? Learn to turn problems into projects. It’s a simple way to start.

> 想改变世界?学会把问题变成工程呀.这是一个简单的开头了.

## 说过最蠢的话?

From:&nbsp; [What is the dumbest thing you have ever said in your life?](http://qr.ae/TUGb02)

Date: October 09 2018

I threw a piece of trash on the floor, and my friend told me to pick it up, and I said:

> 我随手扔垃圾之后,一个朋友叫我捡起来,然后我说:

“I'm doing someone a favor by not picking this up. If I pick it up, the janitor won't have a job.”

> "我不捡起来是做好事好吧.如果捡起来,清洁工就没有工作了."

I genuinely believed that if I picked up my trash, the demand for janitors would decrease. I was a stupid fucking kid.

> 我之前相信如果我捡起垃圾的话,那些清洁工就会被裁员.我那时还是一个没脑的孩子呀.

Little did I know that the janitor would have his job no matter what, and I was just being a complete dick by making it harder for him.

> 在之后我才知道,清洁工无论怎样都会有工作的,而我白白变成了一个混蛋,还给 ta 们添麻烦了.

Pick up your trash people. Don't be a dumbass like I was (am).

> 捡起你的东西,垃圾.别像我一样.

## 能孤独终老吗?

From:&nbsp; [Do we need friends in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGO0k)

Date: October 10 2018

This is Isaac Newton.

> 来,来,来,这个就是牛顿了.

He was… an asshole.

> ta 是一个操蛋的人.

And a loner.

> 同时也是一个孤独的人.

He had no wife, no girlfriends, several dozen enemies and a non-existent social life.

> ta 没有老婆啦,没有女朋友啦,还有一吨的反对者和一个没有社交的生活.

He had just ONE friend his entire life.

> ta 在生命里面,只有一个朋友.

In college, he found a guy named John Wickins.

> 在大学的时候,ta 认识了一个叫 John Wickins 的人.

Their friendship sparked when both of them bumped into each other while taking walks. It turned out, both were fed up with their loudmouth roommates, so they decided to move in together.

> ta 们之间友谊的火花在 ta 们相处间迸发.发现,ta 们两个都受够了各自叽叽喳喳的室友,所以 ta 们决定住在一起算了.

Over the years, they studied together and despite Isaac’s weirdness, Wickins put up with him. He became a caring figure, always making sure Newton ate and slept properly.

> 些许年过去了,ta 们在一起学习啦,憎恨 Iassc 的命运了,Wickins 也忍受下来了.ta 成为了一个会照顾人的人,一直确保牛顿不会饿肚子和睡得安稳一点.

Their discussions largely revolved around academia - a common interest. And Wickins found himself helping Newton with his crazy experiments from time to time.

> 他们的讨论主要围绕着学术界 - 一个共同的兴趣,Wickins 发现自己一直以来经常帮助牛顿做他的疯狂实验.

But it wasn’t to last.

> 但这些都没能走到最后.

There’s speculation that Newton and Wickins had a major falling out years later, and it’s not an unfounded suspicion.

> 有一种推测就是牛顿和 Wickins 在一些年后大吵了一架,这不是毫无根据的猜测.

Newton was cold, callous, rude and generally didn’t have much time for people until he needed them.

> 牛顿是一个冷漠的,无情的,粗鲁的而且平常除了需要被人否则老死不相往来的人.

After Wickins left, he never spoke of Newton again. It’s a bit strange since most people would’ve liked to say they’ve known a famous/influential guy.

> 在 Wickins 离开之后,ta 从没提起过牛顿.这有点奇怪,因为大部分的人都喜欢结交有名的人.

But there’s nothing. He didn’t even mention he knew Newton to his own son.

> 但 ta 什么也没提起,就连自己的儿子也没曾透露.

After he left, Newton realized just how much work Wickins had selflessly been doing for his laboratory.

> 在 ta 离开后,牛顿意识到 Wickins 为 ta 的实验室做了多少的牺牲.

Still, all he did was find a new assistant.

> 但 ta 所做的,仅仅是招了一个新的实验助手.

And that was the end of the friendship.

> 这就是 ta 们友谊的尽头了.

The only one he ever had.

> ta 唯一的一段友谊.

Some people aren’t cut out for friends.

> 有一些人脱离人群.

They can’t stand other people and other people can’t stand them.

> ta 们不能忍受和其他人待在一起,其他人也不能忍受 ta.

They should just lock themselves in rooms and make themselves useful.

> ta 们就把自己所在屋子里面,做着自己的事情.

It’s best for everyone.

> 这对每一个人都好呀.

Newton didn’t exactly have an easy or a fun life. It was riddled with hardship, tragedy, loss and little joy.

> 牛顿没有一个轻松愉悦的生活.到处都是撞壁,悲剧,迷失和仅有的一点快乐.

But he did end up famous.

> 但 ta 的确出名了.

And, as the eternal debate between enjoying life in the present moment versus working to have an eternal impact on Earth rages on, we must think for ourselves.

> 而且,在活在当下享受生活,还是造福地球这种争论下,我们需要结合自身来考虑.

What life do we want?

> 我们想要什么样的生活?

You don’t “need” friends.

> 你不必需要朋友.

They’re not essential like air or water. But they do have benefits and drawbacks, like most things.

> ta 们不是想水和空气一样的生活基础物质.但 ta 们都有着各自的缺点和有点,就像其他的东西一样.

You choose the life you want to lead.

> 你选择你要的生活.

I’ve chosen mine.

> 我选择我的.

## 成功的最基础技巧是什么?

From:&nbsp; [What is the most fundamental skill for success in life?](http://qr.ae/TUGWd1)

Date: October 11 2018

A renowned author once visited Yale to speak at an event for young aspiring writers. At the end, she opened the floor for questions.

> 一个有名的作家有一次来到 Yela 演讲,为了激励那些年轻的作家.在最后,ta 公开提问的环节.

One student, hoping to learn how to write a bestseller, asked, “What’s the trick to becoming a successful writer?”

> 一个学生,希望知道怎样才能写出大卖的书,问道,"成为成功的作家有哪些方法没?"

The author replied, “The application of the ass to the chair.”

> 那个作者回答说,"一个关于 ass 和 chair 的史书呀."

If you want to succeed in life, one of the most fundamental skills you’ll need is the discipline to make yourself sit down and work for it.

> 如果你想要一个成功的人生,最基础的技巧就是你需要坐下来,并开始为之努力.

## 为人父母,你不应该对小屁孩说什么?

From:&nbsp; [As a parent, what should you never say to a teenager?](http://qr.ae/TUGifT)

Date: October 12 2018

Mom: You can tell me anything. I promise I won't scold you or judge you, I promise.

> Mom:你可是告诉我全部东西呀.我保证我不会骂你和评判你的,我绝壁保证.

Kid: “Umm. I'm a little gay, I think. I flunked my recent English test. Also, umm-”

> kid:"好吧,我是 gay 呀.我把英语考试弄砸了.同时,还有-"

Mom: _a little stoicly_ “Go on.”

> Mom: (忍了一下) "继续往下说"

Kid: “A little sad. Yeah.”

> Kid:"有点小悲伤呀.大概就是这样子"

Mom: _takes a deeeeeeeep breath_ “Listen, honey. It's just a phase. No. You aren't gay. You are a girl. You can't like girls. It's a sin! And how could you fail your English test?! I'm so disappointed in you. You're grounded till you raise your grade. SNAP OUT OF IT!”

> Mom:(深吸一口气)"听着,小屁孩.这些都是青春期而已.不会的,你不是 gay.你是女孩子呀,你不能喜欢女孩子.这是罪来的.然后你 tmd 怎么会把英语考试弄砸?我对你很失望.你被禁足到你考过为止.重新振作起来."

Do you know what a parent should never do or say?

> 你知道作为一个父母最不应该说什么吗?

Make empty promises to their kid. You know, I was once in the shoes of the kid I was talking about. My mom promised that she would never judge me, so I told her the truth. The fact that I'm not straight (and possibly never will be one), the fact that I'm struggling with year 3 and I barely passed my first half with a class position of 21/41 (I was usually top 15 in my lower years, so getting a 21 really hit me hard).

> 对 ta 们的小屁孩承诺.你知道的,我曾经历上面说到的那个小屁孩的那种情况.我妈承诺不会评判我的,所以我告诉她真相.事实上我是弯的(而且可能孤独终老),我挣扎在年级三里面,而且我差点就跪在 21/41 的考试上了(在低年级的时候,通常我是 top15,所以在 21 的时候,这对我的打击很大)

She lied.

> ta 骗我.

I got screamed at for almost an hour before she stormed out of my room and slammed the door in my face.

> 我在她摔门而出之前,我被怒吼了差不多一个小时.

Not to make me sound like an ungrateful brathole, but my little trust in her vanished that moment.

> 虽然这样子说有点孩子气,但是那一刻,我对 ta 的信任,丧失了.

Tl;Dr: Don't promise your kid something and not fulfil it.

> 警告: 不要向你的小屁孩承诺你做不到的东西.

Mom: How much did you get for your Algebra test?

> Mom:你在 Algebra 测试里面成绩多少?

Me: 69/80 (actual score, LMAO).

> Me: 69/80(真实的成绩)

Mom: That is... _calculates in her brain_ around 85%. _takes out her phone calculator to check score_ Ah, 86. You know your cousin from [XXX school] got 96 for his Algebra finals? And here you are, getting a pathetic 86.

> Mom: 这大概是..`先在脑里计算一下` 85%,`然后拿出手机确定一下`嗯,86.你知道阿姨的谁拿到了 96 分没?然后你只拿到了 86 分.

Me: The paper is really hard...-

> 我:那试卷太难了....

Mom: And Tommy, you know, the kid you used to call dumb?

> Mom: Tommy,你知道吧,你经常说 ta 很笨的那个小屁孩

Me: I didn't call him dumb, you did.

> 我: 我没有,我不是,别瞎说.你说人家笨而已.

Mom: Whatever, it's the same. Anyway, he got 100 for his Algebra test. What are you doing in class?!?

> Mom:哎呀,都差不多啦.ta 在 Algebra 测试里面拿了 100 分,你在学校都干了啥呀?

Me: _thinks about the times I scribbled down notes_ _also thinks about the times I fell asleep or doodled in class_ Um. I wrote notes and more notes.

> 我: `想起了那些我记下笔记,想起那些我觉得很困的场景`嗯,我记笔记呀,而且记了很多.

Mom: Then why are you getting lower than your cousin and Tommy? Are you that slow? Even your other…

> Mom: 然后你就比你表 x 和 Tommy 低了?你这么笨吗?尽管你其他...

Me: _Hopes that she'll be done talking soon_

> 我: `希望她说一会就好了`

Mom: Aunt Rachel's daughter, you know, Isabelle, got a 90 for Algebra. Is it that difficult to become one of those hardworking, smart kids? How useless can you be?

> Mom: Rachel 阿姨的女儿,你认识的吧,Isabelle 也拿到了 90 分.成为学霸真的那么难吗?你怎么那么没用?

I mean, how difficult is it for parents not to compare us with other kids? I hear this on a regular basis, yeah, close to every other single ever since my first half results were out. I know, all parents — Maybe I overstated, most parents want the best for their kid.

> 我知道,作为一个父母一定要别人家的孩子比较吗?我经常听到这些东西.自从我第一次测试的成绩出来之后,我就经常听到.我知道所有的父母-或许我有点夸大,大多数的父母都希望 ta 的孩子能得到最好的.

But comparing a kid to another kid who got a better grade isn't the way. It's even worse when you insult your kid, calling them “stupid” and “dumb.”

> 但和其他的小屁孩对比不是提高成绩的套路呀.这比羞辱小孩还恶心一点,叫 ta 们`傻逼`和`笨蛋`.

Tl;Dr: Comparing your kids to others isn't fine. Calling them names makes things worse.

> 总结: 和别家小屁孩对比是不好的事.给 ta 们外号更坏了.

I rest my case.

> 我说完了.

## 结婚后,ta 有什么改变了?

From:&nbsp; [In what ways has your spouse changed after getting married?](http://qr.ae/TUGZXe)

Date: October 13 2018

This is going to be fun. But let me tell you, its more like what I thought she was like and how she actually is…

> 这就有点意思了.搬好小板凳,这更像是我以为她是那样子的,可是她实际是....

When we first met through parents, she looked like a shy girl next door. She was smiling and feeling awkward a lot. After we got married and a little more comfortable, she walks around house naked, has 0 level of shyness.

> 我们是通过相亲时遇见的,她像一个害羞的邻家女孩.她很多时候都尴尬的笑着.在我们婚后,我们相处更舒服一点之后,她可能裸着待在房子里面,害羞级别为 0.

I thought I was getting cold feet. She was being forced. Turned out she had insisted to her parents that she wanted to get married, like literally told them in a complete sentence, ‘Dad, I want to get married. I don't have any boyfriend right now. Search a groom for me.’ I'm not even exaggerating, her parents tell this story all the time.

> 我还以为我会被打入冷宫.她被逼和我结婚.后来发现是她坚持要结婚的,就像告诉她父母这样子的话,'Dad,我要结婚.但我现在没有男朋友.你们找一个麻瓜给我吧.'我甚至一点夸大都没有,她的父母一直在说着这个故事.

I thought she didn't like talking. WRONG. She NEVER shuts up. If she does, I'll wake up. Lol, I've started to enjoy it.

> 我以为她不喜欢和人说话.我错了,她从来没停过.如果她停下来了,我会笑醒的.嗯,我会开始享受那段她不说话的时间.

She's frigid. WRONG. Once comfortable, she's a freak.

> 她很高冷的.我又错了.一旦相处熟悉了,她就会变成变态了.

She's so slow and, unhappy person. Wrong. She is hyperactive and becomes happy just about at nothing.

> 她迟钝而且一脸不开心的样子.我又错了.她可是很活跃然后偶尔为一些不存在的东西而开心.

She doesn't like me. Big time wrong. Turned out, she has liked me since day 1. She loves me.

> 她不喜欢我.又错了.后来发现,她从看见我就喜欢我了.她是爱我的.

She'll probably never fight or argue. Wrong. Loveeess to argue, though I don't like to admit it much, she's usually right about things. And people too.

> 她充不争吵.又错了.最喜欢和别人杠了,虽然我不想承认,但大部分都是她是对的.和其他人也是.

Is probably passive aggressive. Wrong. Tells me when things bother her, almost immediately.

> 可能会很被动.但我又错了.如果有什么事她看不过眼,会立马告诉我.

Is dumb. Wrong. She's really smart.

> 她很笨啦.tmd 又错了.实际上她很聪明.

She does not feel much. Wrong. All of her emotions are intense.

> 她很冷漠啦.错了.她的感情是很强烈的.

Is very serious. Wrong. Very very wrong. Can't go on a day without lame jokes. Lame jokes are lifeline to her. She knows they are lame but loves it.

> 非常严肃的啦.错了,错得一塌糊涂.如果一天没看那些冷笑话,她就过不下去.冷笑话是她的生命线.她知道那些很没脑,但是很喜欢那些冷笑话.

As for the changes, she hasn't changed much. Can motherhood be included? Anyways, it suits her well.

> 对于改变来说,她没改变太多.包括成为孩子 ta 妈吗?总的来说,她做得很好了.

She's staying at her parents place with our boy. I miss her. Its been just a day though. I guess, I'll call now.

> 她现在和孩子待在她父母那边.我想她了,都已经去了一天了.我想,我现在该打电话给她了.

## 英国首相牛逼,还是印度总理牛逼一点?

From:&nbsp; [Who is more powerful, Narendra Modi or Theresa May?](https://www.quora.com/Who-is-more-powerful-Narendra-Modi-or-Theresa-May/answers/98438280)

Obviously Modi. Recently a dog died near my house. Someone ran over her. My good neighbor was like “In Modi's rule even a dog is not safe". I don't think anybody in the UK would expect their PM to be accountable for a dog's death in their neighborhood. That's the effect of MODI. Apparently MODI is like god because people expect him to be omnipresent and blame him for any mishap that happens around them.

> 肯定是 Modi(印度总理).最近我邻居的狗挂掉了.有人走到 ta 那里.我那邻居说"在 Modi 定律连狗都是不安全的".我不因为英国的政府会对某个人的狗挂掉而负责.但 Modi 会影响这个.很明显 Modi 就像 CPU 一样的存在,因为人们接受 ta 的无处不在,然后为了自己身边任何一点不好的事发生而责怪 ta.

## 如何让世界变得更好?

“Why don’t you high five a different person every day for a month?” one of my engineers challenged me.

> "为什么不和别人击掌一个月呢?"一个工程师改变的我.

He’d always make fun of my month-long challenges. I did the ketogenic diet, worked out every day, and meditated every morning—among other things.

> ta 一定在取笑我的一个月挑战.我每天都健身啦,在早上冥思一会啦.

So I accepted.

> 所以我接受了这个挑战.

On the 1st day, I high fived my wife.
On the 2nd day, I high fived my CTO.
On the 3rd day, I high fived my neighbor.

> 第一天,我和我老婆击掌.
> 第二天,我和 CTO 击掌
> 第三条,我和邻居击掌

Things got interesting when I ran out of people I knew to high five.

> 当我走出去想和别人击掌的时候,事情开始变得有趣了起来.

I’d stop strangers in the street and say something like, “Oh man, that’s a sweet dog!” and “Hey, I’m loving that jacket!”

> 我会叫一个陌生人停下脚步,然后说一些,"wow,这个狗真甜(笑)"或者"我很喜欢你的外套呀!"

I felt vulnerable putting my hand up and smiling. There was no assurance that they’d high five me back. We live in a society where mistrust is the norm.

> 我自觉的笑着然后伸出我的手.我能确保 ta 们一定会回应我的击掌.我们活在一个不相信任的世界里面.

But 9 cases out of 10, the other person would high five me. Their face would break into a smile, and we’d share this moment of electric joy that would never have happened between two strangers otherwise.

> 但 9/10 的是,那些人会和我击掌.ta 们会笑着,然后我们分享着本来不该存在两个陌生人之间触电的瞬间.

It was amazing.

> 这有点小确幸.

They walked away with a little extra bounce in their step.

> ta 们带着小小的兴奋继续 ta 们的脚步.

And so did I.

> 我也一样.

Who knows what such ripples of happiness can create?

> 谁知道会有什么样的幸福的涟漪出现呢?

I realized that we’ve got a chronic deficit of kindness.

> 我发现我们对善意还远远不足.

And that working on it one high five a time—

> 如果解决从每一次击掌开始...

Is not a bad way of tipping the scales.

> 这对于减少善意的赤字也不是一个坏的方法.
